Hello! I'm a Ph.D student in the Graduate School of Data Science at Seoul National University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hyunwoo Park](https://hyunwoopark.com/).

Iâ€™m actively conducting research with my amazing colleagues at the [Visualization and Business Analytics Lab](https://viba.snu.ac.kr/).

My research interests include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Graph Representation Learning  
- Knowledge Graphs  
- Anomaly Detection



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
